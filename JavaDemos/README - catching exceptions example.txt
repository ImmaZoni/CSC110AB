Please look at the DoWhileMenuDemo from Sept18,19,20.   We added a
try-catch to handle the user inputting a letter instead of a menu option.

If you ever have to use a menu in later courses, just copy and change
the DoWhileMenuDemo.  Then you can concentrate on the logic for each
option instead of remembering how to implement a menu...
