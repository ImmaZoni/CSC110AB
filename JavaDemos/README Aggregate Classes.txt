An Aggregate class is a class whose data consists of instances of other classes.

For example:   A Student class would have data that includes name (a String)
               		A Student class would have data that includes birthday (a Date)
               
When this happens be careful:
   - don't forget to use .equals instead of ==  when you are checking instances of classes

We are going to change Circle.java to now contain a Point and a radius as its data.
